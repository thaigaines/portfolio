My personal portfolio WIP. I will be frequently updating and adding to it.
Solid progress is being made! Adding new functionality and interests slow and steadily.
I will also be frequently updating this with my next steps.

1. Integrate tailwind
2. Add a pop-up contact form
3. Dynamically implement the nav links
4. Complete ver. 1 of the index page (replace placeholders)
5. Route the bones of the new pages
6. Fill out the new routes

I can see clearly what I want, I will just have to implement (or learn how to implement)
my different ideas.

My personal portfolio WIP. I will be frequently updating and adding to it.
Solid progress is being made! Adding new functionality and interests slow and steadily.
I will also be frequently updating this with my next steps.

1. Finish up base aesthetics (fonts and colors) and bones
2. Simplify div classes since there is so much overlap
3. Add a pop-up contact form
4. More animation

Might take a while but good progress so far!
